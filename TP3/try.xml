The baby has to be kept in a neonatal incubator. When the hurricane strikes, all the power goes out and everyone in the hospital leaves.

        <description>March 11, 2011: A huge tsunami triggered by an 8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, crippling the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, releasing radiation, and turning the residents of Futaba into &quot;nuclear refugees.&quot; The devastation experienced by the town -- dead livestock left to rot, crops abandoned, homes and businesses destroyed -- was infinitely worse than anything reported by the newspapers. A year later, many refugees are still unable to return to contaminated homes. The irony of this disaster occurring in a nation that experienced two nuclear bombs is not lost on the victims who poignantly question their responsibility for striking a Faustian bargain with nuclear power. Nuclear Nation examines a tragedy in miniature, but also suggests that it could one day be replicated on a grand scale - perhaps in your own backyard. Written by First Run Features</description>

        <description>Anna, a fearless optimist, sets off on an epic journey - teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven - to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.

        <description>Dallas circa 1985 - Electrician, sometime rodeo bull rider - Ron Woodroof likes living his life hard: heavy smoking, drinking, using cocaine and having sex. He's also a stereotypical redneck with racist and homophobic ideology. While in the hospital on a work-related injury, Ron learns that he is HIV+, and will most-likely die within thirty days. He is angry, in denial and cannot fathom how he could have gotten a disease that only &quot;faggots&quot; have. While in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a gay transvestite. After great introspection, he comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He reads every single available AIDS related research, which shows AZT as the most promising, effective treatment for the disease. Unfortunately in the US, AZT is only in its clinical trials stage. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save his life, or at the very least prolong it, Ron goes on a mission of getting this drug by whatever means possible. This ...
